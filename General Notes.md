Machine Learning is about extracting from data rules that generalizes to new observations.

**Decision trees:** are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for [classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-classification) and [regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-regression). The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.



## Pandas

```py 
pandas.crosstab
```
: compute a single cross tabulation of two or more factors.
